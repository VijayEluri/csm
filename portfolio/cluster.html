  <h2>Clustering</h2>
	<p class="introduction">This clustering work was done in an attempt to discover clusters of dying patients (cold hearted, I know).</p>
  <h3>The Data</h3>
	<p>
		The dataset came from the 2009 Informs contest. It consists of ~500,000 patient visits to hospitals. The dimensionality per
		visit is fairly high, with about 90 attributes. Many of these are for multiple diagnosises and treatments and such, which I
		totally ignored for the purpose of this clustering.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the end I pared the attributes down to six
		<ol>
			<li>[Record Count] : The number of visits to the hospital within the last couple years</li>
			<li>[Interval ] : The time in days since the last hospital visit</li>
			<li>[Age ] : The age of the patient at their visit</li>
			<li>[Length of Stay ] : The time in days spent at the hospital this visit</li>
			<li>[Total Charges ] : The amount of money in dollars the hospital charged for this visit</li>
			<li>[Is Dead ] : A created attribute based on Patient-Disposition where it is 1 if Patient-Dispition = 20 (the patient
				died, and 0 otherwise</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		I attemped to do this preprocessing from within weka but ran into heapspace issues and was not able to figure out how to convert
		the patient disposition into a boolean "is 20, is not 20" value. I ended up doing all of my preprocessing with awk within bash.
	</p>
  <h3>Clustering</h3>
	<p>
		I ran the K-means algorithm, creating 100 clusters using Euclidean Distance as the proximity metric. I decided to go with a relatively large
		set of clusters because I believed that if a clustering of high-risk patients presented itself it would be fairly small and tight. I thought
		that any dead patients would be lost in the much higher percentage of patients which didn't die, for any space which was too large.
	</p>
	<p>
		I came to this conclusion after previous efforts with a lesser number of clusters (20) ended up with nothing but a jumbled mess.
	</p>
  <h3>Results</h3>
	<p>
		In the end 1 of the 99 clusters had a mode "Is Dead" value of true, which actually was a great result. That cluster is interesting because
		it has several aspects to it which you would expect for a set of patients which are likely to die (sorry dead people). It has high charges,
		fairly high age, and medium high length of stay.

		Another interesting cluster was the young, healthy group. They had very short average lenght of stays and cost, and did not die. You would
		expect this from that segment of the population.
