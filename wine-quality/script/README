results.txt contains the quality results of various algorithm/attribute combinations. The columns in this file
are 
	1. # attrs used
	2. attrs used
	3. algo used, in short form
	4. quality as a percentage correct

To run: ./runAllAttrs.sh

runAllAttrs.sh
	This script runs the script which tests the combinations for each attribute count - such as runAttrs1.sh
runAttrs#.sh
	This script itterates through each combination of n attributes. 12 choose 12 means runAttrs12.sh only 
	runs once, 12 choose 1 means runAttrs1.sh runs 12 times, etc. This script creates the training and test
	arff files with selectAttrs.pl and then calls runModels.sh.
selectAttrs.pl
	Transforms full 12 attribute arff file into a subset.
runModels.sh
	Runs a set of classification models on the given training and test arffs. Prints quality of each to std out.
